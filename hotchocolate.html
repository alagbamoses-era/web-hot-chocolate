      <p>
        <strong>Chocolate</strong>
        is a food made from roasted and ground cacao seed kernels that is
        available as a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own or as a
        flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form
        since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE) and the
        majority of Mesoamerican people â”€ including the Maya and Aztecs â”€ made
        chocolate beverages.

        <br />
        The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be
        fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the seeds are
        dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs,
        which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough
        form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called
        chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its
        two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also
        called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in
        varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa,
        which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with
        alkali to produce dutch cocoa.

        <br />
        Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate,
        a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and
        sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk
        powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar,
        and milk, but no cocoa solids.
